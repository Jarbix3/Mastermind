# Mastermind
This project is part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/mastermind)'s Ruby curriculum. 

## Game Description
There are many variations of Mastermind, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). There are 6 different colors pegs that form a 4 peg "code" that another player tries to break in 12 guesses. After each guess, they receive feedback on the number of pegs that were the right color or if that right color was also in the correct spot. In this case, the feedback shows if the number is correct and if it also is in the correct spot.

## Instructions
This Mastermind game is a 1-player game, that is played in the command line. You can choose to be a **Guesser** with a computer randomly generated, or you can choose be a **Mastermind** to create a code for the computer to break. In this game there aren't colors, just numbers, will probably add colors at a later stage.
